			<p class="p1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_(king)">Sri Gupta</a> starts the Gupta Dynasty around 240 A.D. At the start of the Dynasty in the early 300s they controlled a few kingdoms only. The Dynasty’s rise starts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_I">Chandragupta I</a>. Now, don’t confuse Chandragupta I with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a> who founded the <a href="https://swagat687.github.io/History-EAVP2-2021/sources/india/mauryan-empire.html">Mauryan Empire</a> over 600 years before the Gupta Dynasty.</p>

			<p class="p2">Quite surprisingly Chandragupta I doesn’t gain power by wars or battles but through a marriage with Kumaradevi. After the marriage, he is given power of the Northeastern India. After gaining control he, and his descendants and successors increase conquests in India. They then enlarge the Dynasty. Chandragupta’s son, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samudragupta">Samudragupta</a> conquers more land and his son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_II">Chandragupta II</a> conquers even more. But, unlike other dynasties and empires only gaining power, this Dynasty becomes supports and sponsors various cultures, science and arts. It is due to this reason that historians believe the Gupta Empire as the Golden Age of India. The Gupta Empire was during the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalidasa">Kalidasa</a> who is considered the greatest writer in the Sanskrit language. Apart from literature, another great contribution of science was from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> during the same period of time. He established the early ideas of trigonometry, he had a lot of astronomical work based on rotations of the earth, he also had an early concept of gravity.</p>

			<h2 class="facts">Important Facts & Conclusion</h2>
			<p class="p3">During this golden age, the epics <a style="color: palegreen;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and <a style="color: palegreen;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a> took place, the Puranas were written down and formalized.

Interestingly, the iron pillar situated in Delhi, is dated back to Chandragupta II and this pillar is made of raw iron and it hasn’t rusted over 1600 years. A lot of Indian culture can be traced back to this Golden Age. Due to this age, the Islamic Golden Age gains success because of the works stored during this period. This then helps trigger the European Renaissance. Eventually, the Gupta Empire falls around 540 A.D. due to invasions by the Hunas who are people related to the Huns.</p>
